# Cryptocurrencies - Module 18 - Challenge

### Overview and Purpose

Using the k-means clustering algorithm, we are deploying unsupervised machine learning to find relationships between cryptocurrencies from a given dataset. Within this analysis we will show preprocessing, dimension reduction using PCA, K-means clustering, and visualization of the results.

### Results

Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA


Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA


Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means


Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
